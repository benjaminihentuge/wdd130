                <p class="about_us">
                    At Lucid Farms, we specialize in cultivating and selling high-quality fresh products, specifically catfish and chicken, to wholesale and retail businesses in Abuja. Our mission is to meet the high demand for fresh farm produce while ensuring exceptional quality and customer satisfaction.
                    
                    Fish, chicken, and eggs are popular food items in Abuja, and the fresh produce industry has proven to be highly profitable. However, we have identified a significant gap in the market - a high demand and low supply for these items. This presents an excellent opportunity for Lucid Farms to establish ourselves as a reliable and trusted supplier.
