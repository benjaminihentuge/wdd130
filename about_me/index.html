    <h3>Benjamin Ihentuge</h3>
    <p1>Hello everyone! I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I recently completed my BYU Pathway certificate, which was an amazing experience that not only helped me gain valuable knowledge and skills but also allowed me to connect with students from diverse backgrounds around the world. In the picture above, I am on the far left, standing proudly with my siblings who are also enrolled in Pathway. It's been a joy to see them thrive in the program, and I'm especially happy that my younger brother is using Pathway to prepare for his upcoming mission. I believe that Pathway is an excellent way to prepare for whatever comes next in life, and I'm excited to continue sharing its benefits with others.
    I am currently enrolled in BYU Idaho Online, where I am working towards a degree in Applied Technology
    <br>
    <br>
    Hobbies - I have recently found enjoyment in coding and discovering new things, and I am thrilled about the possibilities this field offers. When I'm not studying, I like to relax and recharge by listening to music<br>
